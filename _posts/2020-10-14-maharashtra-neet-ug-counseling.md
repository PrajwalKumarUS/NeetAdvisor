To pursue a lucrative medical career, securing an admission in the top medical college in Maharashtra, requires you to clear NEET exam along with undergoing Maharashtra NEET UG counselling. There is a definite percentile cut off for MBBS and in case you don’t reach that mark, you can opt for other Health science courses. The courses include BAMS, BHMS, BPT, BOT, BP&O, BASLP, and B.Sc (nursing).

Seat allotment for MBBS and BDS admission will take place after the NEET results are declared.  

## Admission Criteria for students 

Admissions are strictly on merit for medical science and it largely depends on the results of students in NEET. Here are a few things that you must know:

- The Maharashtra government recently scrapped the 70:30 quota for admission to the Health Science courses, and admissions will be strictly on merit.
- The decision was based on the widespread protests against the 70:30 quota system.
